This is a simple tool to create a scanline effect for PSP games and homebrew. It's current in beta stages.

I completed this simple POC in under 2 hours with some modifications after googling for information since I had free time before bed. It has a 'shaky' effect from the scan-lines being drawn too (not really intended, but oh well). I'd recommend trying this on an 'actual' PSP first instead of a Vita since it's basically a beta.

Tested on 6.60 PRO-C (PSPGo).

Disclaimer:
Be warned that I'm [i]not[/i] a graphics person and I did the best I could and it definitely needs improvement. Chances are that some games might run really slow. Or the scan-lines may/may not be produced in certain situations (I haven't tested it that much).

There's no button functionality yet for toggling.

How to use
---------------
place 'ScanLine.prx' in your plugins folder and enable it in your game.txt file.# PSP-Blue-Light-Filter
